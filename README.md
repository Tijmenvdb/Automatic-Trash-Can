# Automatic-Trash-Can
This is the final project I did for CSE 321. This was a open ended project and I ended up choosing to create a automatic trash can. The goal of this project was to use the nucleo-L4R5ZI and some preifrals to solve a problem. That trash can I built uses a IR sensor to open up when someone is infront of it. There is also a IR sensor within the trash can The determines if the trash is full. The are 2 modes to this trash can IR mode and Watchdog mode. In IR mode the lid opens and closes as the sensor gets triggered. In Watchdog mode The sensor activates the lid and the lid stays open until there are 3 seconds of inactivity from the sensor. This project was created by Tijmen Van Der Beek
